            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Continue to build on your strong position through testing content improvements for gradual gains. Social activity is important for customer communication, brand awareness and as a marketing channel to bring more visitors to your website. We recommend that you have all of your profiles listed on your page for visibility, and work to build a following on those networks. Creating Social Profiles as well as linking to these from your website can help to build trust in your business and provide other mediums to nurture your customer relationships. We recommend creating all common Social Profiles and linking to these from your website. Most CMS systems will offer fields to enter your Social Profile URLs and will display these in a button row section in the footer. Address & phone number are key pieces of information for customers to contact a local business. However they also help Google identify that the website represents a particular local business to build a complete online profile helping it rank in local search results. Ensure that your full business address and phone number are correct and clearly visible in clear text on the site and not hidden behind expanders or text that could load dynamically. It is important your Google Business Profile (GBP) details are complete and correct - in particular those referred to as the 'NAP' - Name, Address Phone. This obviously helps local customers find your business, but also aids local SEO by helping Google accurately identify online citations of your business to understand the online presence, trust and reputation of your business. We recommend reviewing the details of your business's Google Business Profile and updating it as completely and accurately as possible. Google reviews and ratings are critical for a business - they can directly impact customer trust and reputation of your business which drives foot traffic, but are also a ranking signal Google uses to determine how to rank your business in local search results. Be pro-active in trying to drive reviews for your business (there are multiple methods and online tools to assist) as well as responding to any negative feedback.</p>
